download and install mongo db as usual.

create folders "data" and "log" inside mongo db.

inside data create another folder "db"

open in command prompt(ctrl+r then cmd) go to path of bin folder in mongo db.

then paste this command: 

mongod --directoryperdb --dbpath "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\data\db" --logpath "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\log\mongo.log" --logappend --rest --install

 Now you can start MongoDB as a service by typing this command:

net start MongoDB

You should see a message “MongoDB service was started successfully”.


Now we should be working in the MongoDB shell and we can run that by typing this command within the bin directory.

mongo

If you want to exit the shell, you can do that by typing quit() or use Ctrl-C and then you can stop the MongoDB service with this command:

net stop MongoDB
