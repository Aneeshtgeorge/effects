nodejs is an intrepretor for executing javascript programs.

made of  c++

it is built on google chromes v8 engine, this engine was responsible for executing all html,css javascript files in their browser

every browser has its own engine.

working:

javascript file 
	||
	\/
c++ nodejs v8 engine
	||
	\/
machine code

In nodejs the javascript file is passed to v8 engine which converts into machine code
which is then executed at the machine, the c++ enables the javascript file for performing various
basic operations like file read, write, open etc, thus it allows the basic javascript file to operate in
back end.

jquery is client side scripting tool
node js is server side scripting tool.


we have to download and install node js on our system.
